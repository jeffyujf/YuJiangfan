# Brief Bio

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Before that, I received my Ph.D. degree in the same department in 2018, and received my B.Eng degree in Department of Automation from Harbin Institute of Technology, in 2014. 

<p style="text-align:justify> My research interest locates in small-scale robotics, especially microrobotic swarms for biomedical applications. During my Ph.D.'s research, I accumulated experiences on the understanding of microrobotic swarms from fundamentals, including the generation, actuation, motion control and imaging, to potential applications such as targeted drug delivery, hyperthermia and sensing. I also have expertise on the actuation and navigation of helical microrobots and magnetotactic bacteria for microrobotic missions.</p>

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
