<p style="text-align:justify"> I received my B. Eng. degree from Harbin Institute of Technology (2014), and my Ph. D. degree from Chinese University of Hong Kong (2018). I worked as a postdoctoral fellow in Chinese University of Hong Kong (2018 - 2019), and subsequently in University of Toronto (2019 - 2020). Currently I am an Assistant Professor in School of Science and Engineering, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. My research interests mainly locate in micro/nanorobotics and medical robotics. I have been extensively working in swarm control of micro/nanorobots, including their fundamental modelling, actuation strategy, motion and reconfiguration control, and biomedical applications. Since 2017, I have first-authored 7 top journal papers, including Nature Communications, IJRR, T-Ro, T-Mech, and ACS Nano. Several of my journal papers have been indexed as ESI highly cited papers, and have been highlighted in Science, Nature and international press reports, such as CNN. I have also published 1 monograph and several papers on well-renowned international conferences, including ICRA and IROS. I won several impactful awards, including Toshio Fukuda Best Paper Award in Mechatronics in IEEE ARM 2020, Nature Communications Top 50 physics articles (2018), T-Mech best paper award finalist (2020), CUHK Postgraduate Research Output Award (2018), Hong Kong Young Scientist Award shortlist (2018), the First Prize of International Bionic Innovation Competition (2019). I served as a Topic Editor for Frontiers in Robotics and AI, and Micromachines, an Associate Editor for International Conference on Ubiquitous Robots 2019, and a reviewer for top journals and conferences, including T-Ro, T-Mech, RA-L, ICRA and IROS. </p>
